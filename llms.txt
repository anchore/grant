# Grant - License Compliance Tool

Grant is a command-line tool for viewing and analyzing licenses in container images, SBOM documents, and filesystems. It helps build license compliance reports by applying configurable rules.

## Key Components

- **CLI Interface**: Main entry point in `cmd/grant/main.go`
- **Commands**: Check, list, and inspect operations for license analysis
- **Core Logic**: License evaluation, policy rules, and pattern matching in `grant/` directory
- **Configuration**: YAML-based rule configuration with allow/deny patterns
- **Output Formats**: Table and JSON reporting

## Primary Use Cases

1. Scan container images for licenses: `grant check redis:latest`
2. Analyze SBOM documents: `grant check alpine.spdx.json`
3. Apply license compliance policies with configurable rules
4. Generate reports for license compliance workflows

## Architecture

- Go-based CLI tool using the Anchore Clio framework
- SPDX license identification and pattern matching
- Rule-based evaluation engine with glob pattern support
- Integration with Syft for SBOM generation and analysis
